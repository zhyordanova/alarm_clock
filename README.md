People across the globe use alarm clock features in their devices but this project can be altered in a bit different manner. Some certain YouTube links can be added to a text file and the project is programmed in a way that when a user sets an alarm then the code shall pick a random link from the video and will start playing the YouTube link

## Input and Output

The player enters one of the following options:

- favourite\_song to choose his/her favourite song
- am\_pm to choose the time frame from the day
- alarm\_hour to choose exact hour
- alarm\_minute to choose exact minute

## Solution

After the application verified if the user`s input is correct it is notifying that the alarm is successfully set. When the current time is equal to the chosen by the user time the app is opening a web Brower with the YouTube link provided by the user.
